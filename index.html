<h1>Mateo Maturana</h1>

<p>I am currently a rising Sophomore at Columbia University (CC '23) planning to major in Computer Science with a concentration in Mathematics. Most of the source code for my projects is included in my <a href = "https://github.com/maturanamateo">GitHub</a>, but i'll provide descriptions and alternate links below if necessary. I can be reached at mm5589@columbia.edu. Descriptions of my relevant courses are also included below.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2> 
<p><strong>College</strong></p>
  <p><u>KenKen 2.0 </u>
    <br>
    May '20 - Present. This project is a continuation of the initial KenKen project started in High School. Working with the same team of people, we aim to create a web application where players can compete against each other competitively solving KenKens while also having the opportunity to practice in single player. This will incorporate a backend server and frontend using the Angular Framework written in TypeScript. Languages used include TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS.

<p><strong>High School</strong></p>
<p><u>KenKen</u> 
<br> 
December '18 - February '19. As part of a group project, built a program that generates KenKens of different difficulties and sizes. Future Improvement: Adding a GUI. Current outputs look like <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/KenKen/">this</a>. <a href = "https://www.kenkenpuzzle.com/">KenKen examples</a>.</p>
<p><u>Baseball</u> 
<br> 
January '19 - February '19. Program that simulates an MLB Season. <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/baseball/"> Description</a></p> 
<p><u>World Cup</u> 
<br> 
April '19. Program that simulates the World Cup Qualifiers and the World Cup. <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/worldcup/"> Description</a> </p>

<p><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
  <p><u>MATH UN1208, Honors Math B, Spring 2020</u>
    <br>
    Taught by Evan Warner. Part 2 of a rigorous, accleratde introductory course in calculus and linear algebra. Study of Linear Algebra includes linear independence, rank, determinants, orthogonality, and eigenvectors, culminating in the spectral theorem. Study of Vector Calculus includes the theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes. <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/MATH1208_notes.pdf">Notes</a> - <i> Updated 2/07/20 </i></p>
<p><u>MATH UN1207, Honors Math A, Fall 2019</u> 
<br> 
Taught by Evan Warner. Part 1 of a rigorous, accelerated introductory course in calculus and linear algebra from a theoretical perspective rather than applied. Topics: Introduction to mathematical arguments, single-variable calculus from an abstract perspective, and linear algebra with a view towards calculus in several variables. During this course, Professor Warner maintained a <a href = "http://www.math.columbia.edu/~warner/honorsmathA.html">website</a> with all assignments. 
  *Note: this link may be changed after next year when there is a more current MATH 1207 section*. During this class, I kept detailed notes in LaTeX. They can be found <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/MATH1207_notes.pdf">here</a>. (Currently putting handwritten notes from ~8 lectures into LaTeX) </p>
