<h1>Mateo Maturana</h1>

<p>I am currently a first-year at Columbia University (CC '23) planning to major in Computer Science with a concentration in Mathematics. Most of the source code for my projects is included in my <a href = "https://github.com/maturanamateo">GitHub</a>, but i'll provide descriptions and alternate links below if necessary. I can be reached at mm5589@columbia.edu. Descriptions of my relevant courses are also included below.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2> 
<p><strong>College</strong></p>
  <p><u>Telegram Web App</u> 
    <br>
    November '19 - Present. The goal is to build a web application where customers can buy singing telegrams and where singers can sign up for singing telegrams. Currently, the system is run via google spreadsheets, and it would be better to just automate the entire system. I think Rails would be best for this, so I am currently learning Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>High School</strong></p>
<p><u>KenKen</u> 
<br> 
December '18 - February '19. As part of a group project, built a program that generates KenKens of different difficulties and sizes. Future Improvement: Adding a GUI. Current outputs look like <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/KenKen/">this</a>. <a href = "https://www.kenkenpuzzle.com/">KenKen examples</a>.</p>
<p><u>Baseball</u> 
<br> 
January '19 - February '19. Program that simulates an MLB Season. <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/baseball/"> Description</a></p> 
<p><u>World Cup</u> 
<br> 
April '19. Program that simulates the World Cup Qualifiers and the World Cup. <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/worldcup/"> Description</a> </p>

<p><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
  <p><u>MATH UN1208, Honors Math B, Spring 2020</u>
    <br>
    Taught by Evan Warner. Part 2 of a rigorous, accleratde introductory course in calculus and linear algebra. Study of Linear Algebra includes linear independence, rank, determinants, orthogonality, and eigenvectors, culminating in the spectral theorem. Study of Vector Calculus includes the theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes. <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/MATH1208_notes.pdf">Notes</a> - <i> Updated 2/07/20 </i></p>
<p><u>MATH UN1207, Honors Math A, Fall 2019</u> 
<br> 
Taught by Evan Warner. Part 1 of a rigorous, accelerated introductory course in calculus and linear algebra from a theoretical perspective rather than applied. Topics: Introduction to mathematical arguments, single-variable calculus from an abstract perspective, and linear algebra with a view towards calculus in several variables. During this course, Professor Warner maintained a <a href = "http://www.math.columbia.edu/~warner/honorsmathA.html">website</a> with all assignments. 
  *Note: this link may be changed after next year when there is a more current MATH 1207 section*. During this class, I kept detailed notes in LaTeX. They can be found <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/MATH1207_notes.pdf">here</a>. (Currently putting handwritten notes from ~8 lectures into LaTeX) </p>
