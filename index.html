<h1>Mateo Maturana</h1>

<p>I am currently a first year at Columbia University (CC '23) planning to major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Most of the source code for my projects are included in my <a href = "https://github.com/maturanamateo">GitHub</a>, but i'll provide descriptions and alternate links below if necessary. I can be reached at mm5589@columbia.edu. Descriptions of my relevant courses are also included below.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
  <p><u>MATH UN1208, Honors Math B, Spring 2020</u>
    <br>
    Some Description </p>
<p><u>MATH UN1207, Honors Math A, Fall 2019</u> 
<br> 
Taught by Evan Warner. Part 1 of a rigorous, accelerated introductory course in calculus and linear algebra from a theoretical perspective rather than applied. Topics: Introduction to mathematical arguments, single-variable calculus from an abstract perspective, and linear algebra with a view towards calculus in several variables. During this course, Professor Warner maintained a <a href = "http://www.math.columbia.edu/~warner/honorsmathA.html">website</a> with all assignments. *Note: this link may be changed after next year when there is a more current MATH 1207 section*. During this class, I kept detailed notes in LaTeX. They can be found <a href = "https://maturanamateo.github.io/MATH1207_notes.pdf">here</a>. </p>
